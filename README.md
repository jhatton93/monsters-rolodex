# monsters-rolodex
This application displays monsters with different names and a search bar. Once you start typing into the search bar it will filter through the monsters, displaying only those that match what is being typed. Even as you delete characters in the search bar it will continue to filter the monsters and show those that match.

<h2>How I worked on this project</h2>
My goal was to learn about React and ReactDOM, while creating an application.
<ul>
  <li>I built this app using "create react app".</li>
  <li>I strengthened my JavaScript skills and learned about JSX.</li>
  <li>I dived deep into learning about what it really means to render and re-render onto a page.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to navigate this project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The monster images are from RoboHash. </li>
  <li>The application fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder REST API.</li>
  <li>The font is chosen from a Google API font.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If I had more time I would change this</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I originally created it with class components before I switched over to function components. I should have uploaded to GitHub to show the differences between the two.</li>
</ul>
